types of data collected from experiment:
	- datasheets (from rating paradigms)
		- empathy paradigm
		- videorate
	- EEG
	- video (room cameras, include sensitive data)
	- video (computer screen capture, include sensitive data)

available stimulus, pipeline data:
	- video of nature used for Nature paradigm, does not
	include any subject sensitive data
	- Empathy script and source files (pictures)

sessions:
	- single session

paradigms:
	- rest (I think it's a special, common and recognized type of paradigm,
	subjects sit with minimal movement for X time)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
	- blink (same as rest but subjects are requested to blink throughout the
	duration of the paradigm)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
	- Nature (both mother and child what a nature video)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
		- nature video used as stimulus
	- Empathy (a series of pictures and a set of rating questions)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
		- available rating datasheets (child only)
		- perhaps available screen capture
	- face to face (face to face interaction between mother and child)
	    - available room cameras
	    - available EEG data
	- Skype (Skype interaction between mother and child)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
		- available screen capture
	- Whatsapp (mother and child interact with each other via Whatsapp web)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
		- available screen capture
	- videorating (mother and child rewatch their face to face(?) interaction
	and rate it)
		- available room cameras
		- available EEG data
		- available rating datasheets

maybe relevant:
	- there are available video encoding files
	- there are physical documents describing each experiment,
	data includes order of paradigms and notes on unexpected
	events (for example pressing a paradigm start key twice,
	something not working, someone messed up the order of hats
	and the mother and child are wearing the wrong hats etc.)

unknowns:
	- some subjects were repeated, are we going to use both
	session's data in BIDS? if yes should we add a session layer
	or is there a more convenient way to go about it?
	- is it allowed to make a different (pairwise) distribution
	of data, where every "subject" folder represent a mother-child
	pair? (for source files only)
	- mandatory keys for EEG's json files?
	- mandatory keys for datasheet's json files?

TODOs:
	- given this data, figure out what should be the folder
	structure
